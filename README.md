# Carbon Vue

This is a heavily modified version of Vue.js that is intended to be extremely light-weight.

It is intended to be used as a pure JavaScript UI library, and has a very very limited use case.

**If you are looking to build a Vue.js application, you have come to the wrong place.**

## Usage

```typescript
import Vue from '@uoft-treat/carbon-vue'

new Vue({/* your config */});
```

# Carbon Vue

This is a heavily modified version of Vue.js that is intended to be extremely light-weight.

It is intended to be used as a pure JavaScript UI library, if you wish to build a SPA or to use anything within the Vue.js ecosystem, you have come to the wrong place.

## Usage

```typescript
import * as Vue from '@uoft-treat/carbon-vue'

new Vue({/* your config */});
```
